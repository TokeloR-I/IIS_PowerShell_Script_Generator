# IIS Installation Script Generator

A simple, self-contained web application that helps Windows Server administrators generate PowerShell scripts to automate the installation of Internet Information Services (IIS) and its selected features.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Select IIS Features** ‚Äì Easily choose desired IIS components from a user-friendly interface.
- **PowerShell Script Generation** ‚Äì Generates a ready-to-use PowerShell script (`.ps1`) based on your selections.
- **Copy to Clipboard** ‚Äì Conveniently copy the generated script.
- **Download as `.ps1`** ‚Äì Download the script directly as a PowerShell file.
- **Self-Contained** ‚Äì Runs directly from a single HTML file in any modern web browser. No server or complex setup required.

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Running the Application (Local HTML)

1. **Download** ‚Äì Save the `iis_installer.html` file (or the full HTML content provided by the model previously) to your local computer.
2. **Open** ‚Äì Open the saved `.html` file using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. **Select Features** ‚Äì Tick the checkboxes for the IIS features you wish to install. Some common and recommended features are pre-selected by default.
4. **Generate Script** ‚Äì Click the **Generate PowerShell Script** button. The script will appear in the text area below.
5. **Copy or Download** ‚Äì  
   - Use **Copy Script** to copy the script to your clipboard.  
   - Click **Download `.ps1`** to save it as `install_iis.ps1`.

### 2. Using the Generated PowerShell Script on Windows Server

The generated script is designed to be run on a Windows Server.

1. **Transfer** ‚Äì Move the `install_iis.ps1` file (or paste the copied script) onto your target Windows Server.
2. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Search for "PowerShell" in the Start Menu.
   - Right-click **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as Administrator**.  
     ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Installing Windows features requires elevated privileges.
3. **Navigate to Script Location**:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads
````

4. **Execute the Script**:

   ```powershell
   .\install_iis.ps1
   ```
5. **Handle Execution Policy (if needed)**:
   If you see an error about script execution being disabled:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   After running the script, revert the policy if desired:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

This will display perfectly on GitHub with nice **section separation**, readable lists, and proper **code highlighting** for PowerShell commands.  

If you want, I can also make a **version with a clickable table of contents** so GitHub auto-links each section. That would make it even more polished.
